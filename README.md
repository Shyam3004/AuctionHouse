### Auction House
Auctions are among the oldest economic institutions in place and they are still in use. In this dissertation, we explore the efficiency of common auctions when values are interdependent. The value to a particular bidder may depend on information available only to others and asymmetric. In this setting, it is well known that sealed-bid auctions do not achieve efficient allocations in general since they do not allow the information held by different bidders to be shared. With the point and click of the mouse, one may bid on an item they may need or just want, and in moments they find that either they are the top bidder or someone else wants it more, and youâ€™re outbid! , while meeting the needs of its users.  Online Auction System project is used to bid from the comfort of ones owns preferred place has seen a change like never seen before.
